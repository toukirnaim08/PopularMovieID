"What are the most popular movies for different age groups?"

Data set user.dat has an information about age groups

* 1: "Under 18"

* 18: "18-24"

* 25: "25-34"

* 35: "35-44"

* 45: "45-49"

* 50: "50-55"

* 56: "56+"

I have provided a movie ID for the movie that has the highest number of ratings and that number for each age group 
from datasets in ml-1m.zip file.
Thank You
